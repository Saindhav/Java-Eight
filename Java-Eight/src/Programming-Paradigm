Programming paradigm - how you write/organize your code. 

Object-oriented -- Organize data and logic in objects (properties, methods), 
				  organize code in logical entities. Think about code as worldly objects.

Procedural ---  Write sequential series of execution steps/tasks.
				"Top to bottom" code execution.

Functional -- Organize code in functions with clearly defined tasks.
			  Pass data around via parameters.
